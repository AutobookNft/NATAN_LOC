# Part III – Testing as Oracles

Most tests answer the question: “Does it work?”

Oracular tests answer: **“Will it fail with grace? Will it speak the truth when everything collapses?”**

## Properties of an Oracular Test

- It describes a behavior *through absence, failure or anomaly*.
- It is semantically meaningful even if all the code around it changes.
- It uses exceptions as intentional narratives.

These are not validations. These are rituals of semantic confirmation.
