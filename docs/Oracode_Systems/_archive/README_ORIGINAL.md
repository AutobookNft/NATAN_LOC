# Oracode – The Unified Doctrine of Living Code

> “Il codice non è solo ciò che scriviamo.  
> È ciò che sopravvive per parlarci quando non ci saremo più.”

Oracode is a unified semantic framework that merges the principles of Ultra Documentation Philosophy (UDP) and AChaos into a single doctrine for writing, testing, and understanding code that must survive time, mutation, and incomplete transmission.

---

## 🌌 Purpose

Oracode helps developers build codebases that:

- Explain themselves even when authors are gone
- Survive refactoring, rotation, and system trauma
- Can be interpreted by humans and AI alike

## 📜 Core Principles (The 8 Pillars)

1. **Explicitly Intentional** – Code must express its “why”.
2. **Semantically Coherent** – Names and structures must speak the same language.
3. **Contextually Autonomous** – Fragments must make sense alone.
4. **Interpretable** – Comments are portals, not notes.
5. **Variation-Ready** – Code must be designed to evolve.
6. **Interrogable** – Code must answer: “Who are you?”
7. **Imperfect-Transmission Tolerant** – Like myths, it must survive partial loss.
8. **Linguistically Universal** – All documentation must be in English.

## 🧪 Testing as Oracles

Tests are not just assertions — they are oracles.  
They confirm not only behavior, but *meaning*.  
Attributes such as `#[CoversNothing]`, `#[Group('oracular')]`, and `#[Test]` are used to make this explicit.

## 🔁 Oracular Refactoring Flow

Oracode formalizes the conversion of legacy tests into semantic, interpretable, and future-proof artifacts.  
A dedicated Artisan command (`ultra:convert-tests`) applies these transformations automatically.
